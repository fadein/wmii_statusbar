DESIGN RATIONALE:
=================

Provides a statusbar for wmii by periodically writing a string out to
/rbar/status via libixp.

It aims to be more efficent than a pipeline of programs kicked off by a shell
script.  Plus, I was having problems with that pipeline hanging around whenever
I re-execed wmii - the effect was two or more processes competing to update my
statusbar.

This version of wmii_statusbar works with the latest Hg version of wmii - it
won't work with the outdated wmii tarball that everybody seems to be tripping
over.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
=====================
1. Prerequisites:
	libixp: libixp is a stand-alone client/server 9P library
	http://libs.suckless.org/libixp

	alsa-lib: for volume information.  If you don't want to display the volume,
	you can hack alsavolume.[ch] out of the Makefile, and remove
	getAlsaVolume() from wmii_statusbar.c.

2. Hack wmii_statusbar.[ch] to your liking.  By default, you'll get a statusbar
	that looks like this:
	Vol:XX% CPU:XX% Mem:XX% Bat:hrs.min %a %D %I:%M%p
	It will refresh itself every 2 seconds.

3. Finally, you need to tell your wmiirc how to kick this off.  In my wmiirc, I
   replaced the Action status stanza with this:

Action status
    set +xv
    if wmiir remove /rbar/status 2>/dev/null; then
        sleep 2
    fi
    echo colors "$WMII_FOCUSCOLORS" | wmiir create /rbar/status
    $HOME/.wmii-hg/wmii_statusbar
